# Customer Churn Prediction
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for Customer Churn using Machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical customer data and identifying churn patterns, the model helps businesses anticipate at-risk customers and implement proactive retention strategies to reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value.

# Implementation Methods
* Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
* Feature Selection and Engineering
* Class Imbalance Handling using SMOTETomek
* Model Comparison (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM)
* Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna
* Model Evaluation using Confusion Matrix and F1-Score
# Features
* Comprehensive Data Preprocessing
* Balanced Dataset
* Multiple Model Evaluation
* Automated Hyperparameter Tuning
* Scalable Workflow
# Tech Stack
* Language: Python
* Libraries & Tools:
  * Pandas, Numpy
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn
  * Scikit-learn
  * Imbalance-learn
  * Optuna
# Results
* Best-Performing Model: Random Forest
* Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, F1-Score
* Outcome: Random Forest model demonstrated exceptional performance in predicting customer churn with an Accuracy of 96.1%
